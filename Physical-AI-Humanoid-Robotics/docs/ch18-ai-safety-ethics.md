# Chapter 18: AI Safety and Ethics

## AI Safety Considerations

AI safety in robotics addresses ensuring systems behave as intended, especially in safety-critical applications. Key areas include:

- Verification and validation: Proving system safety properties
- Safe exploration: Learning without causing harm
- Human oversight: Maintaining human control in critical situations
- Transparency and explainability: Understanding AI decision-making

Ethical considerations include privacy, job displacement, and autonomous weapons.
