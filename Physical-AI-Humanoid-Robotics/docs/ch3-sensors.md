# Chapter 3: Sensors in Robotics

## Sensor Types

Sensors in robotics are critical components that allow robots to perceive their environment and internal states. The main categories include:

- Proprioceptive sensors: Measure internal states like joint angles and motor position
- Exteroceptive sensors: Perceive external environment, such as cameras for vision and microphones for sound
- Force/torque sensors: Measure interaction forces with objects and environment

Common sensor types:
1. Cameras and vision systems
2. Accelerometers and gyroscopes
3. Force and tactile sensors
4. Range finders (LiDAR, ultrasonic, infrared)
