# Chapter 12: Robotics Software Frameworks

## Robotics Frameworks

Robotics software frameworks provide standardized tools and libraries for developing robotic applications. Popular frameworks include:

- ROS (Robot Operating System): The most widely used framework with extensive community support
- ROS2: The next generation with improved architecture and real-time capabilities
- YARP: Yet Another Robot Platform, emphasizing portability and simplicity
- Actin: Commercial framework with advanced kinematics and dynamics

These frameworks provide communication, device abstraction, simulation, and visualization tools.
