# Chapter 4: Actuators in Robotics

## Actuator Types

Actuators are components that enable robots to move and interact with their environment. They are essentially the "muscles" of a robot, converting energy (usually electrical) into mechanical motion.

Main actuator types:
1. Electric motors: Most common in humanoid robots due to precision and controllability
2. Servo motors: Provide precise angular control for joint movements
3. Linear actuators: Create straight-line motion for specific applications
4. Pneumatic and hydraulic actuators: Provide high power-to-weight ratios but require external systems
