# Chapter 16: Agricultural Robotics

## Agricultural Robotics

Agricultural robotics addresses labor shortages and improves farming efficiency. Applications include:

- Autonomous tractors and harvesters: Automated field operations
- Precision agriculture: Targeted application of resources
- Crop monitoring: Continuous surveillance and data collection
- Harvesting robots: Automated picking and collection of crops

These systems often operate in unstructured outdoor environments.
