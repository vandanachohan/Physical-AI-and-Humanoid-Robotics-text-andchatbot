# Chapter 2: Foundations of Physical AI

## Introduction

The foundations of Physical AI encompass the core principles that govern how intelligent systems interact with the physical world. These foundations include:

1. Embodied Cognition: The idea that intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent and its environment
2. Sensorimotor Integration: The seamless combination of sensory input and motor output
3. Adaptive Control: The ability to adjust behavior based on environmental feedback

These principles distinguish Physical AI from traditional AI, which primarily operates in digital domains.
