# Chapter 11: Human-Robot Interaction

## HRI Principles

Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) focuses on designing robots that can effectively collaborate with humans. Core principles include:

- Transparency: Robots clearly communicating their intentions and state
- Trust: Building reliable and predictable interaction
- Safety: Ensuring human safety during interaction
- Intuitive interfaces: Matching human expectations and capabilities

Key research areas include social robotics, collaborative robots (cobots), and assistive robotics.
