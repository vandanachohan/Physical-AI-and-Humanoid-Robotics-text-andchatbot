The main categories include:\r\n\r\n- Proprioceptive sensors: Measure internal states like joint angles and motor position\r\n- Exteroceptive sensors: Perceive external environment, such as cameras for vision and microphones for sound\r\n- Force/torque sensors: Measure interaction forces with objects and environment\r\n\r\nCommon sensor types:\r\n1. Cameras and vision systems\r\n2. Accelerometers and gyroscopes\r\n3. Force and tactile sensors\r\n4. Range finders (LiDAR, ultrasonic, infrared)"},"id":"3","prevChapter":{"id":2,"title":"Chapter 2"},"nextChapter":{"id":4,"title":"Chapter 4"}},"__N_SSG":true}
