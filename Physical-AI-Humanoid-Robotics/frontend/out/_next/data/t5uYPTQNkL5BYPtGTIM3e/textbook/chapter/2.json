These foundations include:\r\n\r\n1. Embodied Cognition: The idea that intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent and its environment\r\n2. Sensorimotor Integration: The seamless combination of sensory input and motor output\r\n3. Adaptive Control: The ability to adjust behavior based on environmental feedback\r\n\r\nThese principles distinguish Physical AI from traditional AI, which primarily operates in digital domains."},"id":"2","prevChapter":{"id":1,"title":"Chapter 1"},"nextChapter":{"id":3,"title":"Chapter 3"}},"__N_SSG":true}
