Key approaches include:\r\n\r\n- Sampling-based planners: RRT, RRT*, PRM for high-dimensional spaces\r\n- Optimization-based planners: Trajectory optimization for smooth motions\r\n- Search-based planners: A* and Dijkstra for discrete environments\r\n- Learning-based planners: Using neural networks to plan in complex environments\r\n\r\nConsiderations include completeness, optimality, and real-time performance."},"id":"9","prevChapter":{"id":8,"title":"Chapter 8"},"nextChapter":{"id":10,"title":"Chapter 10"}},"__N_SSG":true}
