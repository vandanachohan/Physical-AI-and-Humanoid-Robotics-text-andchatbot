They are essentially the \"muscles\" of a robot, converting energy (usually electrical) into mechanical motion.\r\n\r\nMain actuator types:\r\n1. Electric motors: Most common in humanoid robots due to precision and controllability\r\n2. Servo motors: Provide precise angular control for joint movements\r\n3. Linear actuators: Create straight-line motion for specific applications\r\n4. Pneumatic and hydraulic actuators: Provide high power-to-weight ratios but require external systems"},"id":"4","prevChapter":{"id":3,"title":"Chapter 3"},"nextChapter":{"id":5,"title":"Chapter 5"}},"__N_SSG":true}
