Humanoid robots must plan both whole-body motions and individual joint trajectories while considering:\r\n\r\n- Kinematic constraints\r\n- Dynamic stability\r\n- Collision avoidance\r\n- Energy efficiency\r\n\r\n## Types of Motion Planning\r\n\r\n### 1. Path Planning vs. Trajectory Planning\r\n\r\nPath planning focuses on finding a collision-free route from start to goal, while trajectory planning adds timing information to create executable movement commands.\r\n\r\n### 2. Sampling-Based Methods\r\n\r\nSampling-based methods like Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRMs) and Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs) are popular for high-dimensional spaces like those encountered in humanoid robotics.\r\n\r\n### 3. Optimization-Based Methods\r\n\r\nOptimization-based approaches formulate motion planning as an optimization problem, allowing for the incorporation of multiple objectives and constraints.\r\n\r\n## Key Challenges\r\n\r\n- High-dimensional configuration space\r\n- Real-time computation requirements\r\n- Dynamic environments\r\n- Multi-objective optimization\r\n\r\n## Applications\r\n\r\n- Walking and locomotion\r\n- Arm manipulation\r\n- Whole-body coordination\r\n- Navigation in cluttered environments\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nMotion planning remains an active area of research in humanoid robotics, with new techniques continuously emerging to address the computational and physical challenges inherent in these complex systems."},"tutorialId":"motion-planning"},"__N_SSG":true}
