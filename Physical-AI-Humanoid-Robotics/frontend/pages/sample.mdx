# Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI

Physical AI ( fizikal ai ) is an interdisciplinary field that combines artificial intelligence with physical systems. It focuses on creating intelligent machines that can understand, interact with, and adapt to the physical world.

## Key Concepts

Step-by-step understanding:

1. **Perception** - Gathering information about the environment
2. **Cognition** - Processing information to understand and reason
3. **Action** - Executing movements or tasks in the physical world

Physical AI systems typically integrate sensors, actuators, and intelligent control algorithms to achieve their goals.

## History of Physical AI

The field of Physical AI has evolved significantly since the early days of robotics. Key developments include:

- **1950s:** First programmable robots
- **1960s:** Introduction of sensor feedback systems
- **1980s:** Development of autonomous robots
- **2000s:** Integration of machine learning in robotics
- **2010s:** Advancement in humanoid robots and AI integration
