# Chapter 1: Overview and History

## Overview

Physical AI ( fizikal ai ) is an interdisciplinary field that combines artificial intelligence with physical systems. It focuses on creating intelligent machines that can understand, interact with, and adapt to the physical world.

Step-by-step understanding:
1. Perception - Gathering information about the environment
2. Cognition - Processing information to understand and reason
3. Action - Executing movements or tasks in the physical world

Physical AI systems typically integrate sensors, actuators, and intelligent control algorithms to achieve their goals.

## History

The field of Physical AI has evolved significantly since the early days of robotics. Key developments include:

- 1950s: First programmable robots
- 1960s: Introduction of sensor feedback systems
- 1980s: Development of autonomous robots
- 2000s: Integration of machine learning in robotics
- 2010s: Advancement in humanoid robots and AI integration
