# Chapter 7: Computer Vision in Robotics

## Vision Systems

Computer vision in robotics enables perception of the 3D world through visual sensors. Key capabilities include:

- Object detection and recognition
- Scene understanding
- Visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)
- Pose estimation for manipulation tasks

Common techniques include convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for recognition, and geometric methods for 3D reconstruction.
