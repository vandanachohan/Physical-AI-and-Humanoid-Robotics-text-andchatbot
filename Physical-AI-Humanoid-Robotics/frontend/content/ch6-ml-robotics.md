# Chapter 6: Machine Learning for Robotics

## ML for Robotics

Machine learning in robotics enables systems to improve performance through experience. Key applications include:

- Learning from demonstration: Teaching robots tasks through human examples
- Reinforcement learning: Learning optimal behaviors through reward signals
- Imitation learning: Replicating expert behaviors
- Deep learning: Processing complex sensor data like images and point clouds

Challenges include sample efficiency, safety during learning, and real-time inference requirements.
