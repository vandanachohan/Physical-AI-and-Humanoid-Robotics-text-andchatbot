# Chapter 9: Motion Planning

## Motion Planning Algorithms

Motion planning involves determining a sequence of movements to achieve a goal while avoiding obstacles. Key approaches include:

- Sampling-based planners: RRT, RRT*, PRM for high-dimensional spaces
- Optimization-based planners: Trajectory optimization for smooth motions
- Search-based planners: A* and Dijkstra for discrete environments
- Learning-based planners: Using neural networks to plan in complex environments

Considerations include completeness, optimality, and real-time performance.
