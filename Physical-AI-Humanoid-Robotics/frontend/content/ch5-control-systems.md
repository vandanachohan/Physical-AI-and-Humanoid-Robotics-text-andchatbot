# Chapter 5: Control Systems for Robotics

## Control Theory

Control systems in robotics govern how robots execute movements and maintain stability. Key concepts include:

- Feedback control: Using sensor data to adjust system behavior
- PID controllers: Proportional-Integral-Derivative controllers for precise control
- State estimation: Determining the system's internal state from sensor data
- Trajectory tracking: Following predefined paths with accuracy

Advanced control methods include adaptive control, which adjusts to system changes, and optimal control, which minimizes specific cost functions.
