# Chapter 10: Path Planning

## Path Planning Algorithms

Path planning focuses on determining geometric routes from start to goal positions. Key methods include:

- Grid-based algorithms: A*, Dijkstra's algorithm on discretized environments
- Visibility graphs: Connecting start, goal, and obstacle vertices
- Voronoi diagrams: Paths through open space corridors
- Probabilistic roadmaps: Precomputed roadmaps in configuration space

Modern approaches combine multiple methods and incorporate dynamic obstacle prediction.
