# Chapter 17: Autonomous Vehicles

## Autonomous Vehicles

Autonomous vehicles represent a significant application of robotics and AI. Key technologies include:

- Perception systems: LiDAR, cameras, and radar for environment sensing
- Localization: Precise positioning using GPS, IMU, and map matching
- Path planning: Route computation and dynamic obstacle avoidance
- Control systems: Smooth and safe vehicle operation

Levels range from driver assistance (L1) to full automation (L5).
