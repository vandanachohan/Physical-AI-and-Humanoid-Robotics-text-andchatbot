# Chapter 14: Manufacturing and Industrial Robotics

## Industrial Robotics

Industrial robotics encompasses automated systems for manufacturing processes. Key applications include:

- Assembly: Precise and repeatable assembly of components
- Material handling: Automated transport and positioning of materials
- Welding: Consistent and high-quality joining of materials
- Painting: Uniform coating application with minimal waste

Modern industrial robots incorporate advanced vision, force control, and collaborative features.
