3. To cultivate systems thinking, engineering literacy, and ethical awareness in the development of advanced robotic platforms and autonomous agents.
4. To contribute to the global discourse on next-generation skills required in a world where human intelligence is augmented by artificial and robotic intelligence.

Article II. Scope

1. The textbook covers the conceptual, mathematical, computational, and mechanical fundamentals of Physical AI.
2. Core domains include sensing, actuation, control systems, cognition, human-robot interaction, humanoid robotics, safety, alignment, and responsible innovation.
3. Supplementary domains include applied robotics for industry, research methodologies, simulation workflows, and cross-disciplinary integrations with design, biology, and cognitive science.
4. All content is designed to serve undergraduate, postgraduate, and professional learners seeking competency in robotics and embodied intelligence.

Article III. Learning Framework

1. Curriculum chapters shall be organized to progress from foundational concepts to advanced implementations.



Prompt for /sp.specify - Create baseline specification

/sp.specify
Create a complete baseline specification for my project.

Project context:
I am building a textbook and documentation system for “Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics” using Docusaurus.
I have already created a constitution for the project in `.specify/constitution.md`.
I also have a `claude.md` file that describes project goals, capabilities, rules, and assistant behavior.

Instructions:

1. Read and incorporate the content of `.specify/constitution.md` and `claude.md`.
2. Generate a baseline specification that defines:

   * Project purpose and scope
   * Documentation architecture for Docusaurus
   * Content model for the textbook chapters
   * High-level functional requirements
   * Non-functional requirements
   * Content taxonomy (courses, modules, robotics domains, AI domains)
   * Folder structure for documentation and assets
   * Style guidelines, tone, and formatting rules
   * Contribution model (how content updates should be handled)
   * Any workflows required for publishing, versioning, or deployment
3. Ensure that the output is optimized for a Docusaurus project, including recommended directory hierarchy, sidebar structure, and MDX usage.
4. Ensure the specification aligns strictly with the principles in `constitution.md`.

Output:
A complete, coherent, project-level baseline specification ready to use inside the `.specify` system and suitable for generating the corresponding Docusaurus documentation.

This prompt ensures that you only describe everything once in claude.md, and the system uses it to generate the full project.
You must read the full contents of my `claude.md` file and use it as the single source of truth for generating my entire documentation system. All project rules, goals, structure, tone, constraints, and outputs must follow what is written in `claude.md`.

Using only the information defined in `claude.md`:

1. Generate a complete Docusaurus documentation architecture for my project.
2. Create the recommended folder structure, sidebar configuration, routing, and MDX templates.
3. Prepare the content model for chapters, modules, robotics topics, and Physical AI concepts.
4. Define workflows for building, writing, versioning, and publishing the documentation.
5. Ensure the system can auto-generate pages in future steps by following the rules in `claude.md`.
6. Integrate `.specify/constitution.md` as a governing document that constrains tone, mission, and educational philosophy.

Your task:
Produce a full Docusaurus-ready specification and scaffolding based entirely on my `claude.md` file, without requiring repeated instructions from me later.

# Project Master Specification (claude.md)

# Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics: Foundations, Engineering, and Intelligent Systems

This file defines the authoritative, single-source specification for the entire Docusaurus-based textbook on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.
All Spec-Kit Plus slash-commands, Claude Code, MCP server integrations, and code generation must rely solely on the requirements in this file and the governing `.specify/constitution.md`.

The system must automatically produce the complete project:

• `/sp.constitution`
• `/sp.specify`
• `/sp.plan`
• `/sp.tasks`
• `/sp.implement`

No additional instructions from the user should be required.

The final output must be a ready-to-deploy documentation system and codebase.
