Key methods include:\r\n\r\n- Grid-based algorithms: A*, Dijkstra's algorithm on discretized environments\r\n- Visibility graphs: Connecting start, goal, and obstacle vertices\r\n- Voronoi diagrams: Paths through open space corridors\r\n- Probabilistic roadmaps: Precomputed roadmaps in configuration space\r\n\r\nModern approaches combine multiple methods and incorporate dynamic obstacle prediction."},"id":"10","prevChapter":{"id":9,"title":"Chapter 9"},"nextChapter":{"id":11,"title":"Chapter 11"}},"__N_SSG":true}
