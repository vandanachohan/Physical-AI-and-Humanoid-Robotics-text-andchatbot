Key concepts include:\r\n\r\n- Feedback control: Using sensor data to adjust system behavior\r\n- PID controllers: Proportional-Integral-Derivative controllers for precise control\r\n- State estimation: Determining the system's internal state from sensor data\r\n- Trajectory tracking: Following predefined paths with accuracy\r\n\r\nAdvanced control methods include adaptive control, which adjusts to system changes, and optimal control, which minimizes specific cost functions."},"id":"5","prevChapter":{"id":4,"title":"Chapter 4"},"nextChapter":{"id":6,"title":"Chapter 6"}},"__N_SSG":true}
