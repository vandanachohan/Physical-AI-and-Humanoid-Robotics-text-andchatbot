It focuses on creating intelligent machines that can understand, interact with, and adapt to the physical world.\r\n\r\nStep-by-step understanding:\r\n1. Perception - Gathering information about the environment\r\n2. Cognition - Processing information to understand and reason\r\n3. Action - Executing movements or tasks in the physical world\r\n\r\nPhysical AI systems typically integrate sensors, actuators, and intelligent control algorithms to achieve their goals.\r\n\r\n## History\r\n\r\nThe field of Physical AI has evolved significantly since the early days of robotics. Key developments include:\r\n\r\n- 1950s: First programmable robots\r\n- 1960s: Introduction of sensor feedback systems\r\n- 1980s: Development of autonomous robots\r\n- 2000s: Integration of machine learning in robotics\r\n- 2010s: Advancement in humanoid robots and AI integration"},"id":"1","prevChapter":null,"nextChapter":{"id":1,"title":"Chapter 1"}},"__N_SSG":true}
