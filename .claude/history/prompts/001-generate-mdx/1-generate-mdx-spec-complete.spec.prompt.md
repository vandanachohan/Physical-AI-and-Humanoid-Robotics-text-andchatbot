## Prompt

```text
/sp.specify generate textbook MDX files

Prompt:

Using the full contents of `claude.md` as the single source of truth, generate **all chapter and appendix MDX files** for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook.

Requirements:
1. Create proper folder structure under `/docs`:
   - `/docs/part1/`, `/docs/part2/`, `/docs/part3/`, `/docs/part4/`, `/docs/part5/`, `/docs/appendices/`
2. For each chapter and appendix in `claude.md`, create an MDX file with a title placeholder.
3. Include initial section headings from the book outline.
4. Ensure files are ready to be displayed in Docusaurus with the autogenerated sidebar.
5. End output with a confirmation message: “All MDX files generated and ready to view in Docusaurus.
```

## Response snapshot

The feature specification for "Generate Textbook MDX Files" has been completed and validated. The spec is ready for the planning phase.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Successfully created a comprehensive feature specification for generating MDX files.
- 🧪 Tests: Spec validated successfully against the quality checklist.
- 📁 Files: Created `E:/specifyplus/hackatone-1/specs/001-generate-mdx/spec.md` and `E:/specifyplus/hackatone-1/specs/001-generate-mdx/checklists/requirements.md`.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user can now proceed with `/sp.plan` for this feature.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully recovered from `Write` tool error by deleting and recreating the spec file. Realized `CLAUDE.md` was not the textbook content, and clarified with user to create a *spec* for the generation process.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: `Write` tool error, incorrect assumption about `CLAUDE.md` content, `create-phr.sh` script failure.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Improve error handling for `Write` tool and `create-phr.sh` to provide more informative messages.
