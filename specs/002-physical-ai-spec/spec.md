# Feature Specification: Physical AI Humanoid Robotics

**Feature Branch**: `002-physical-ai-spec`
**Created**: 2025-12-05
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Physical AI Humanoid Robotics"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-12-09

- Q: How does the robot's learning and improvement capability work? → A: Learning means adjusting motor control parameters based on successful/unsuccessful attempts (e.g., grip strength, movement precision).
- Q: How should the robot handle authentication and security for user interactions? → A: The robot should authenticate users before executing sensitive tasks (e.g., tasks involving dangerous objects, access to restricted areas).
- Q: How many simultaneous users should the robot be able to handle in its operational environment? → A: The robot should handle up to 10 simultaneous users in its operational environment.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Autonomous Object Manipulation (Priority: P1)

A user wants the humanoid robot to autonomously identify, grasp, and move objects within a specified environment to a new designated location.

**Why this priority**: This is a core capability for any physical AI humanoid robot, enabling it to perform practical tasks and interact with its surroundings.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by placing a set of distinct objects in a known environment, providing the robot with a target location, and observing its ability to successfully manipulate the objects without human intervention, delivering value by demonstrating basic operational autonomy.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the robot is powered on and in a designated workspace with various objects, **When** a user commands the robot to move a specific object to a new location, **Then** the robot autonomously identifies, navigates to, grasps the object, transports it, and places it at the target location.
2. **Given** the robot is attempting to grasp an object, **When** the object is slightly repositioned by an external force, **Then** the robot re-adjusts its grip and successfully completes the grasp.

### User Story 2 - Human-Robot Interaction for Task Assignment (Priority: P2)

A user wants to assign a task to the humanoid robot using natural language commands, and receive verbal confirmation and progress updates from the robot.

**Why this priority**: Enables intuitive human-robot collaboration and makes the robot accessible to non-technical users, enhancing its utility in real-world scenarios.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by a user giving a verbal command (e.g., "Robot, please clean up the desk"), and the robot responding verbally to confirm the task and providing updates during execution, delivering value through seamless human-robot communication.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the robot is in an idle state and awaiting commands, **When** a user issues a verbal command for a task (e.g., "Please bring me the red cup"), **Then** the robot audibly confirms understanding of the task and begins execution.
2. **Given** the robot is performing a task, **When** the user asks "What are you doing?", **Then** the robot provides a verbal update on its current progress.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the robot encounters an object too heavy or too large to manipulate? The robot should report the inability to perform the task and ask for human assistance or a modified instruction.
- How does the system handle conflicting verbal commands from multiple users? The robot should prioritize commands based on pre-configured user hierarchies or request clarification if permissions are equal.
- What if a critical sensor fails during an autonomous task? The robot should enter a safe, halted state and report the sensor failure.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The robot MUST be able to perceive its environment using a combination of visual and depth sensors.
- **FR-002**: The robot MUST be able to identify and localize common objects within its operational environment.
- **FR-003**: The robot MUST possess the necessary manipulators (e.g., robotic arms, grippers) to grasp and move a variety of objects.
- **FR-004**: The robot MUST be able to navigate autonomously within a defined space, avoiding obstacles.
- **FR-005**: The robot MUST be capable of processing natural language commands from users.
- **FR-006**: The robot MUST be able to generate natural language responses and provide verbal feedback to users.
- **FR-007**: The robot MUST be able to adapt its grasping strategy based on object properties (e.g., shape, fragility).
- **FR-008**: The robot MUST be able to learn and improve its task performance by adjusting motor control parameters based on successful/unsuccessful attempts (e.g., grip strength, movement precision).
- **FR-009**: The robot MUST authenticate users before executing sensitive tasks (e.g., tasks involving dangerous objects, access to restricted areas).
- **FR-010**: The robot MUST be able to handle up to 10 simultaneous users in its operational environment.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Robot**: Represents the physical humanoid robot, its current state (location, battery, operational status), and capabilities.
- **Task**: A defined action or sequence of actions assigned to the robot, including parameters like target objects, locations, and priorities.
- **Object**: Any manipulable item in the robot's environment, with attributes like type, current location, and physical properties.
- **Environment**: The physical space in which the robot operates, including static and dynamic elements, obstacles, and designated zones.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: The robot can successfully manipulate and move 90% of specified objects within a 1 square meter area to a new target location in under 5 minutes per object.
- **SC-002**: Users can successfully assign 80% of common household tasks to the robot using natural language commands with an accuracy rate of 95% in understanding.
- **SC-003**: The robot responds to verbal queries regarding its task status within 2 seconds.
- **SC-004**: Object manipulation tasks are completed with less than 5% damage rate to manipulated objects.
- **SC-005**: The robot's pathfinding and object identification accuracy improves by 10% after 100 hours of continuous operation (learning metric).
