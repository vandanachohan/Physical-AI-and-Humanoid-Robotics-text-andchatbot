📘 Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

AI-Native Textbook • Multi-Agent System • Robotics Learning Platform

A modern, AI-powered textbook project focused on Physical AI, Humanoid Robotics, and Embodied Intelligence.
This repository includes the complete book structure, chapters, diagrams, agent workflows, tutorials, and automation tools used to build and maintain the textbook.

Built with: Next.js, TailwindCSS, Docusaurus, Claude Code, Qwen, and OpenAI Agents.

The Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Project is a fully automated learning system designed to help students master:

 Humanoid Robotics
 Embodied & Physical AI
 Actuators, Sensors & Mechatronics
 Locomotion, Balance & Movement
 Energy Systems & Power Design
 Robotics Algorithms & Control
 Intelligent Agents & Cognitive Models

The project uses AI agents to generate, update, and maintain textbook content such as chapters, examples, diagrams, and practice exercises.
